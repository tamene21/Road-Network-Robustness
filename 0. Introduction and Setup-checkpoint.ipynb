    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This small collection of Jupyter (IPython) notebooks serves as a introduction to the [NetworkX](http://) Python package. It is intended for students who are interested to run network simulation or network analysis using NetworkX and Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to understand and follow most of the code examples without prior programming experience. However, in order to gain most from the tutorials it is advisable to have some basic programming knowledge. If you have never programmed before I would recommend the [Python code academy course](http://www.codeacademy.com/python). There is also an assumption that you understand something about Complex Networks (this practical course has a corresponding series of lectures). If you would like to learn more about Complex Networks I would advise the free [e-book](barabasilab.neu.edu/networksciencebook/) by Laszlo Barab√°si.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course consists of four Jupyter notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <span style=\"color:green\">**_NetworkX Basics_**</span> - this is more or less a direct copy of the official [NetworkX tutorial](http://www.networkx.com). It will teach you about the basic forms of graphs in NetworkX, basic drawing, how to create nodes, edges, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <span style=\"color:green\">**_Network Data Analysis using NetworkX_**</span> - this covers an example of analysing real world data (the worldwide airline network) in NetworkX. It shows various centrality measures, how to plot the degree distribution, how to export to various file formats (that can work with Gephi), fitting plots with powerlaw, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <span style=\"color:green\">**_Network Robustness using NetworkX_**</span> - this repeats some classic experiments related to the robustness of scale-free  networks when nodes fail or are attacked. It also includes robustness analysis of the airline network used in part two.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. <span style=\"color:green\">**_Epidemic Spreading using NetworkX_**</span> - this builds a simple SIR model for epidemic spreading, then investigates different vacination strategies to assess the effectiveness is prevent the disease spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step you must make is to ensure that you have all the necessary software/libraries installed on your own machine, see the below section for instructions on how to do this.\n"
